# Public holidates 

### Welcome to this simple Node package.

This package allows you to show the public holidays of a given country for the current year. You just need to input holidates followed by name of the country you want and then it returns the public.

However you need to install to set up the environement:

=> In the terminal run "sudo npm i -g h0lidates" to install it:

Available commands are:

holidates country name.
Shows holidays on given country name on the current year.

#### P.S: We might not have all the public holidays for all the countries in world.

That is it all for me have fun :)
